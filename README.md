# Worldwide-Deaths-by-Risk-Factors-Dashboard
**Worldwide Deaths by Risk Factors from 1990 to 2017**  
The dashboard was developed as part of a school project to visualize global deaths caused by various risk factors. It provides interactive insights into the top causes of death across different countries and years, helping users explore health trends and identify critical public health issues. The visualizations include breakdowns by region, risk category, and time, using clean and accessible charts.

Built with data visualization tools and Python libraries to support better decision-making and public awareness through data.

## Introduction
Risk factors: The determinants associated with an increased risk of a disease and result in deaths of humans. Nowadays, the number of deaths may increase or decrease depending on the risk factors present in a country. It is crucial to understand the risk factors associated with premature death. This is because mortality can be reduced if the risk factors that a population is exposed to are identified and addressed. Furthermore, increasing public awareness of these risk factors is essential to help people maintain optimal health and prevent disease.

Category of risk factors:
- Environmental
- Metabolic
- Behavioral
- Occupational

## Objectives

- Identify risk factors contribute to the highest total annual deaths by country from 1990 to 2017
- Comparison of specific risk factors from 1990 to 2017

## Tools used
